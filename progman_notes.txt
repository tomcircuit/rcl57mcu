 From TI patent, the ORDER of the segment activation
 7,6,5,2,4,0,1,3
 (don't really care about this so much I don't think)
 
Segment numbering:
E, F, B, G, C, A, D, P
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  (WVU)

This makes the keyboard mapping sane, also, as the segment # is then the row #





   1  1  1        
   2  1  0  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1
   
      L. #  #     C  C  C  C         	These are the "library" flash programs   21-99
   
      U. #  #     C  C  C  C				These are the "user" EEPROM programs   01-20
		 
		 
		 ## is program number
		 CCCC is CRC-16 of program (or "- - - -" if blank)
		 
	  
+ increase #
- decrease #	  
STO store program in slot # if it's a USER slot (1-20)
RCL recall program from slot #
GTO goto L.21
RST goto U.01
CE clear program in slot # if it's a USER slot (1-20)
R/S exit program manager
	  
	  
Keep the same 50us tick:

Enter with slot = 01
