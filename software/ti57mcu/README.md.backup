Rcl57mcu was inspired by the work of Jeff Parsons and Paul Novaes, from whose work I was able to develop a microcontroller-based TI-57 emulator. The rcl57mcu embedded software is more a less an embedded
'wrapper' around the RCL57 "Engine" by Jeff Parsons, which can be found on his wepage [here](https://www.pcjs.org/machines/ti/ti57). 

Rcl57mcu bring a few enhancements over original TMC1500 IC in TI-57:
 
- a hardware "drop-in" replacement for TI-57 TMC1500 DIP-28
- calculation at 4x the speed of the original TI-57 
	+ display timing and PAUSE are same as original
- non-volatile storage/retrieval of up to 20 user programs
- a "power save" mode if the keyboard is left idle
- USB micro-B rechargeable 3.7V LiPo battery 
- (tbc) lower overall energy consumption

In theory, rcl57mcu could be used as speedup/retrofit in TI-55 and TI-42/"MBA" calculators, as they use the same TMC1500 IC. Of course, the correct ROM image would need to be used. I do not have these calculators, so I cannot say as to whether or not this actually works...

RCL57mcu hardware was designed using KiCAD 7.0. Design files can be found at the GitHub repository.
